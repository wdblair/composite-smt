From our capabilities results we see that both Yices and Z3 can solve most benchmarks within
a second. Clearly, anything Yices can do, Z3 can also do. In terms of what formulas can be decided
by Z3 and Yices, both are on an even footing. Our capability results suggestthat 

We would like to explore whether there is any significant performance difference between Yices and 
Z3 within the 1 second time frame. The motivation is to find logics and formulas that are susceptible 
to optimization with Yices 2.
