1. Add lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
run:
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib

2. Compile the Composite Solver 
Go to the src/ directory and run command:
    make

'make clean' can be used to clean up all compiled files.

3. Run composite solver on test files
The test/ directory contains some test smt2 files that can be used to test the composite solver. Individual files can be run by doing:
    ./composite file_name

for example one can run the file 'test/test1.smt2' by running the command:
    ./composite test/test1.smt2

To run the composite solver on all the files in the test directory, the following command can be used directly:
    find ./test -name *.smt2 -exec ./composite {} \;
